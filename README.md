KernelJS
========

Module pool (all modules should in a AMD form)

I expect this tool would be the foundation of sojs project.

In next version production of our team, I will promote all members
to use the loader. All other modules already exist could be easily
reused.

sojo is a modules pool of AMD. It finally provides supports of all
productions in our Company, Department, I expect.


Support:
IE6-9
Chrome
FF (to be tested)
Safari (to be tested)
