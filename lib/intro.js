 * browser code in development
 *
 * JavaScript is a powerful object oriented language with some of the
 * fastest dynamic language interpreters around. The official JavaScript
 * specification defines APIs for some objects that are useful for building
 * browser-based applications. However, the spec does not define a standard
 * library that is useful for building a broader range of applications.
 *
 * I . The CommonJS API will fill that gap by defining APIs that handle many
 * common application needs, ultimately providing a standard library as rich
 * as those of Python, Ruby and Java. The intention is that an application
 * developer will be able to write an application using the CommonJS APIs
 * and then run that application across different JavaScript interpreters
 * and host environments. With CommonJS-compliant systems, you can use
 * JavaScript to write:

 * 1. Server-side JavaScript applications
 * 2. Command line tools
 * 3. Desktop GUI-based applications
 * 4. Hybrid applications (Titanium, Adobe AIR)
 *
 * II. The Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) API specifies a mechanism
 * for defining modules such that the module and its dependencies can
 * be asynchronously loaded. This is particularly well suited for the
 * browser environment where synchronous loading of modules incurs
 * performance, usability, debugging, and cross-domain access problems.
