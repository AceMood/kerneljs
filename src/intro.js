 * The Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) API specifies a mechanism
 * for defining modules such that the module and its dependencies can
 * be asynchronously loaded. This is particularly well suited for the
 * browser environment where synchronous loading of modules incurs
 * performance, usability, debugging, and cross-domain access problems.
